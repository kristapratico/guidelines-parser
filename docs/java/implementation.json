There are two valid arrangements for implementation code, which in order of preference are the following: Implementation classes can be made package-private and placed within the same package as the consuming class. Implementation classes can be placed within a subpackage named implementation. CheckStyle checks ensure that classes within an implementation package aren't exposed through public API, but it is better that the API not be public in the first place, so preferring to have package-private is the better approach where practicable."

For example: ```java @ServiceClientBuilder(serviceClients = {ConfigurationClient.class, ConfigurationAsyncClient.class}) public final class ConfigurationClientBuilder { ... } ``` This builder states that it can build instances of ConfigurationClient and ConfigurationAsyncClient. There are two annotations of note that should be applied on model classes, when applicable: The @Fluent annotation is applied to all model classes that are expected to provide a fluent API to end users. The @Immutable annotation is applied to all immutable classes. Client libraries must make use of the robust logging mechanisms in azure core, so that the consumers can adequately diagnose issues with method calls and quickly determine whether the issue is in the consumer code, client library code, or service."

For example, the code below will create a ClientLogger instance for the ConfigurationAsyncClient: ```java public final class ConfigurationAsyncClient {   private final ClientLogger logger = new ClientLogger(ConfigurationAsyncClient.class);   // example async call to a service that uses the Project Reactor APIs to log request, success, and error   // information out to the service logger instance   public Mono&lt;Response&lt;ConfigurationSetting&gt;&gt; setSetting(ConfigurationSetting setting) {     return service.setKey(serviceEndpoint, setting.key(), setting.label(), setting, getETagValue(setting.etag()), null)       .doOnRequest(ignoredValue -&gt; logger.info(\"Setting ConfigurationSetting - {}\", setting))       .doOnSuccess(response -&gt; logger.info(\"Set ConfigurationSetting - {}\", response.value()))       .doOnError(error -&gt; logger.warning(\"Failed to set ConfigurationSetting - {}\", setting, error));   } } ``` Note that static loggers are shared among all client library instances running in a JVM instance.

Distributed tracing libraries creates spans - units of unique work. Each span is in a parent-child relationship. As you go deeper into the hierarchy of code, you create more spans. These spans can then be exported to a suitable receiver as needed. To keep track of the spans, a distributed tracing context (called a context in the remainder of this section) is passed into each successive layer. For more information on this topic, visit the [OpenTelemetry] topic on tracing. The Azure core library provides a service provider interface (SPI) for adding pipeline policies at runtime. The pipeline policy is used to enable tracing on consumer deployments. Pluggable pipeline policies must be supported in all client libraries to enable distributed tracing. Additional metadata can be specified on a per-service-method basis to provide a richer tracing experience for consumers."
