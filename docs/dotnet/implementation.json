    "text": "DO make your serialization and deserialization code version resilient. Optional JSON properties should be deserialized into nullable model properties. As described in general enumeration guidelines, you should use enum types whenever passing or deserializing a well-known set of values to or from the service. There may be times, however, where a readonly struct is necessary to capture an extensible value from the service even if well-known values are defined, or to pass back to the service those same or other user-supplied values: The value is retrieved and deserialized from service, and may contain a value not supported by the client library. The value is roundtripped: the value is retrieved and deserialized from the service, and may later be serialized and sent back to the server. In those cases, you should define a structure that: Is readonly. Implements IEquatable<T> that compares only the string value. Stores only the string value. Defines static properties with well-known values. Defines equality, inequality, and an implicit cast-from-string operators. Overrides Equals, GetHashCode, and ToString methods. Equals(object) and GetHashCode should be attributed with EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never). Type of value comparison should be selected on per-service basis, if the service is inconsistent with how string values are returned the case-insensitive comparison is allowed.

With these traces, customers can view the timing of these calls and any errors that occurred. Distributed traces for network calls are sent automatically by the HttpPipeline in Azure.Core. Library authors must trace public service methods using ClientDiagnostics.CreateScope. The .NET Activity types are used for this internally by the ClientDiagnostics via .NET DiagnosticSource (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/DiagnosticSourceUsersGuide.md) or ActivitySource (https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/diagnostics/distributed-tracing-instrumentation-walkthroughs) "
