Include information on service limits and errors they might hit, and how to avoid and recover from those errors. As you write your code, doc it so you never hear about it again.

    "text": "DO NOT combine more than one operation in a code snippet unless it's required for demonstrating the type or member, or it's in addition to existing snippets that demonstrate atomic operations. For example, a Cosmos DB code snippet should not include both account and container creation operations--create two different snippets, one for account creation, and one for container creation. Combined operations cause unnecessary friction for a library consumer by requiring knowledge of additional operations which might be outside their current focus. It requires them to first understand the tangential code surrounding the operation they're working on, then carefully extract just the code they need for their task. The developer can no longer simply copy and paste the code snippet into their project.
